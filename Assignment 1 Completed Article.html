<h2>
	Eagles, Superbowl champs once again
</h2>
<p>
	Stout defense, renewed balanced run and pass attack will lead eagles to second Superbowl in three years
</p>
<h3> Why eagles won </h3>
<ol>
	<li> Defensive ROY TJ edwards shuts downs NE rushing attack </li>
	<li> Malcom Jenkins 3 picks of aging Tom Brady</li>
	<li> Carson Wentz efficient game management and steady dose of Jordan Howard, Alshon Jeffrey, and Zach Ertz </li>
</ol>
<p> 
Bill belichik and Tom Brady were in unfamiliar territory falling behind early and never mounting anything that resembled a comeback. Eagles were swarming everywhere stuffing the run the first half, and then picking brady repeatedly in the second half. With only 3 plays in the redzone all in the last 2 minutes of the game. Could this be the end of the Brady-Belichik Era?
